      <h4>Bandwidth Aggregation Program (BAP)</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="flow-text">
      Pricing through our Bandwidth Aggregation Program allows NGO members to save 30-55% off standard retail pricing. This is done by grouping the purchases of many NGOs in a specific region to increase the order volume through the highest quality provider which reduces cost for all participating parties.

      <h4>Pre-negotiated Internet Service Provider (ISP) Pricing</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="flow-text">
      Telecom4Good has built the Bandwidth Aggregation Program (BAP) with ISPs to leverage the aggregation of NGO’s Internet bandwidth within a region. When NGOs collaborate and aggregate their Internet bandwidth as a group through Telecom4Good, participating NGOs can significantly reduce the cost of Internet service for everyone.

      <h4>Internet Service Provider (ISP) Research</h4>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class="flow-text">
      Telecom4Good has relationships with more than 129 local ISPs throughout Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia and is continually looking for additional reliable local providers of high quality services in both metropolitan and rural areas. Working closely with each local ISPs to understand where new last mile solutions (fibre, etc.) are available as well as their outage reports helps to determine which carriers have the most stable fibre, microwave, wireless and VSAT networks within each region.

      <h4>ISP Analysis</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="flow-text">
      Telecom4Good analyzes each local ISP through performance standards, customer satisfaction, trouble ticket reporting and recurring outages. This information provides detailed reports to help achieve accurate ISP matrices throughout each region to only recommend the best ISPs.

    <blockquote>
      <h4>ISP Contract Negotiation</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="flow-text">
      Telecom4Good pre-negotiates ISP contracts to ensure that the NGO has protection against degraded Internet service. From Termination for Cause to Chronic Outage clauses that set the standard for stable and reliable internet, the NGO can terminate the contract without penalty anytime throughout the contract term.
      Additionally, if your legal team or executives have specific contractual points required, Telecom4Good will negotiate each of your points with the ISP so that you can save internal resources needed to negotiate the contract.

      <h4>Managed ISP Implementation</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="flow-text">
      Telecom4Good assists NGOs in procuring ISP services and order forms directly with the local ISP. Once the order form is signed, Telecom4Good’s dedicated project manager will liaise with the local NGO team and the local ISP to ensure an accurate and timely delivery of service.
