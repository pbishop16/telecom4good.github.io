          Telecom4Good’s greatest value to NGOs is our executive relationships with more than 129 Internet Service Providers throughout Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia. These relationships have created the Bandwidth Aggregation Program (BAP) to leverage the power of collaborations with NGOs in concentrated areas to further reduce the cost of Internet services. <br><br>
          NGOs that purchase Internet services for one location do not gain the leverage to negotiate significantly discounted pricing and favorable contractual terms to meet their business needs. But when Telecom4Good negotiates the Internet bandwidth of 3+ NGOs in a specific region, the cost of Internet service is reduced 30-55%. The power of many NGOs is far greater than the power of just one.

        Telecom4Good helps NGOs procure Internet services in all of the countries in yellow on the above map. Africa is our most developed region to provide the greatest assistance to NGOs. Options for Internet service providers and pricing can be provided by using our pricing request portal at <a href="http://telecom4good.org/request-pricing">Request Pricing</a>.<br><br>
        Telecom4Good continues to develop new Internet service provider relationships at the requests of NGOs. If you require services in a country that we do not currently have on our map, please reach out to us to see where we are within that country to assist.

        Telecom4Good negotiates purchases of Internet service for the NGOs in a region as a package. Each NGO contracts separately and receives their monthly invoice for service independently of other NGOs. Your participation affects the pricing for all NGOs within a region, but you are not contractually tied to any other NGO. If you cancel your service during the term of your contract or after the contractual period, it does not affect the pricing for other participating NGOs.<br><br>
        Each NGO can add additional contractual terms to the order form as well. Telecom4Good pre-negotiates contractual terms for Termination for Cause and Chronic Outage clauses to protect the NGOs against degraded service throughout the contract term.
